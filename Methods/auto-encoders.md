- Autoencoders (AE) are a family of neural networks for which the input is the same as the output*. 
- They work by compressing the input into a `latent-spacere` presentation, and then reconstructing the output from this representation.
- `Convolutional Autoencoders` learn how to remove noise from images
    - image reconstruction, removing parts of the image
    - image colorization
    - generating higher resolution images
